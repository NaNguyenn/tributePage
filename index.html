                <b> Here's a time line of Michael Jackson's life:</b>
            </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Aug. 29, 1958</b> - Michael Joseph Jackson is born to Katherine and Joe Jackson in Gary, Ind. His
                    older siblings are Rebbie, Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, LaToya and Marlon. Later, brother Randy and

                <li>
                    <b>1962</b> - Michael, Marlon, Jackie, Tito and Jermaine combine to form a band. At first, their
                    father does not approve, but later changes his mind and manages the band. Jackson sings lead vocal
                    on most of the songs.
                </li>

                    <b>1969</b> - The song "I Want You Back" jumps to the number-one singles spot. "ABC (1970)," "The
                    Love You Save" and "I'll Be There" follow suit.
                </li>

                    <b>1971-1972</b> - Jackson goes solo, and his singles "Got to Be There," "Rockin' Robin" and "I
                    Wanna Be Where You Are" storm the charts — as does "Ben," a ballad about a pet rat featured in the
                    horror movie Ben.
